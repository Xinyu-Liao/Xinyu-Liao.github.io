I'm a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). The key question that I'm interested in is phonetic variation in speech production and perception. I use experimental and quantitative methods to investigate how phonetic-phonological, psycholinguistic, and social factors probabilistically condition variation in acoustic-phonetic signals, and how listeners perceptually adapt to or compensate for such variation. These questions could inform models of phonological representation, mental lexicon, and the evolution of sound patterns. I also aim to explore broader questions about memory organization and perceptual flexibility within cognitive science. 

With my past training, I apporach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, especially from phonetics-(morpho)phonology interface, psycholinguistics, and variationist sociolinguistics. [my CV is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wzoN6M7h2LV8K9Ap_wHIig0adZYHjof/view?usp=sharing)

Here is a list of the topics that I'm currently working on:
1. Perceptual Adaptation and Sound Change: supervised by Dr.[Yoonjung Kang](https://www.yoonjungkang.com/), I'm exploring the phonetic recaliberation/adaptation in speech perception with implications for usage-based models of phonology and mechanisms of diachronic sound change
2. Sociophonetic Cognition: Drs. [Derek Dennis](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/people/derek-denis), [Jessamyn Schertz](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jschertz/index.shtml) and I are currently working on social perception of prosodic variation

I've graduated with an MPhil (Distinction) in Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), where I worked with Drs. [Miriam Meyerhoff](https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/professor-miriam-meyerhoff),  [Jose Elias-Ulloa](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/jose-elias-ulloa), and [Matt Hunt Gardner](https://www.matthuntgardner.com). 

I'll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out :)
