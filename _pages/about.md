My name is Xinyu. [pronunciation of my name in Mandarin Chinese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1okVhTp6oE66znEiqjmFdc5tZdxcsDbKI/view?usp=drive_link) The letter “x” in pinyin (the romanization system for Chinese) represents the alveolo-palatal fricative /ɕ/. Since this sound doesn’t exist in many languages, you can approximate it with the English “sh” /ʃ/ sound. I’m happy to be addressed as “Shin-yu” or any similar variants :)

I'm a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in phonetics and computational psycholinguistics. The central focus of my research is speech variability in production and perception, bridging psycholinguistic experiments, computational modeling, large-scale corpus analysis, cross-linguistic phonetic universals, and language change in cultural evolution.

        <h3> Perceptual Recalibration and Sound Change </h3>
        <p> By exposing listeners to innovative phonetic input, I explore biases in the phonetic recalibration of phonemic categorization, with implications for episodic exemplar models of phonology, and the role of acoustic memory and word frequency encoding in diachronic sound change </p>
