My name is Leslie Xinyu Liao. I'm a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). The central focus of my research is perceptual flexibility in speech perception and computational speech models, bridging perception experiments, computational modeling, and theories of phonetic learning and language evolution. Human perceptual and memory systems are remarkably adaptiveâ€”listeners continuously recalibrate their category boundaries (e.g., for speech sounds) in response to novel input. I am particularly interested in how listeners adapt to or compensate for the innovative phonetic input, how explicit computational models can be built to probe human cognition, and whether computational models can exhibit similar perceptual biases as human does.

With my past training, I apporach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, especially from phonetics/phonology, psycholinguistics, computational modeling, and variationist sociolinguistics. [my CV is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wzoN6M7h2LV8K9Ap_wHIig0adZYHjof/view?usp=sharing)

Here is a list of the topics that I'm currently working on:
1. Perceptual Learning, Item Frequency, and Sound Change: supervised by Dr.[Yoonjung Kang](https://www.yoonjungkang.com/), I'm exploring the phonetic recaliberation/adaptation in speech perception with implications for usage-based models of phonology and mechanisms of diachronic sound change
2. Sociophonetic Cognition: Drs. [Derek Denis](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/people/derek-denis), [Jessamyn Schertz](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jschertz/index.shtml) and I are currently working on social perception of prosodic variation

I've graduated with an MPhil (Distinction) in Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), where I worked with Drs. [Miriam Meyerhoff](https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/professor-miriam-meyerhoff),  [Jose Elias-Ulloa](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/jose-elias-ulloa), and [Matt Hunt Gardner](https://www.matthuntgardner.com). 

I'll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out :)
