I'm a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in studying variation & change, learnability, and item specificity/frequency underlying phonetics-phonology and morphology in human language faculty and mental lexicon. 

With my past training, I apporach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, especially from phonetics-(morpho)phonology interface, psycholinguistics, and variationist sociolinguistics.

Here is a list of the topics that I'm currently working on:
1. Perceptual Adaptation and Sound Change: supervised by Dr.[Yoonjung Kang](https://www.yoonjungkang.com/), I'm exploring the phonetic recaliberation/adaptation in speech perception with implications for usage-based models of phonology and mechanisms of diachronic sound change
2. Loanword Phonology: I'm interested in using constraint-based probabilistic grammar to model the adaptation of non-native sound structures in native (morpho)phonology by using dictionary data and on-line adaptation experiments 
3. Sociophonetic Cognition: Drs. [Derek Dennis](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/people/derek-denis), [Jessamyn Schertz](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jschertz/index.shtml) and I are currently working on social perception of prosodic variation in multicultural Toronto English
4. Phonological Variation and Documentation: My MPhil thesis focused on documenting ongoing sound changes in Tsat, an endangered Austronesian language in Hainan, China
5. Bilingualism & Language/Dialect Contact: bilingual and bi-dialectal speaker's speech production & perception, second dialect morphology and phonology

I've graduated with an MPhil (Distinction) in Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), where I worked with Drs. [Miriam Meyerhoff](https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/professor-miriam-meyerhoff),  [Jose Elias-Ulloa](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/jose-elias-ulloa), and [Matt Hunt Gardner](https://www.matthuntgardner.com). 

I'll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out :)  You can also download my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7Tu_o_kVpxBblMywxOP27UgWudizcA_/view?usp=sharing) here
