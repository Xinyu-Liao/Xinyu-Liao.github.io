My name is Xinyu Liao. I'm a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in phonetics and psycholinguistics. The central focus of my research is speech variability in production and perception, bridging psycholinguistic experiments, computational modeling, and theories of learning and language change. I am particularly interested in how listeners adapt to innovative phonetic input and integrate multiple cues during comprehension, and how computational models can be built to probe human cognition. 

With my past training, I apporach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, especially from phonetics/phonology, psycholinguistics, computational modeling, and variationist sociolinguistics.

        <h3> Perceptual Recalibration and Sound Change </h3>
        <p> By exposing listeners to innovative phonetic input, I explore biases in the phonetic recalibration of phonemic categorization, with implications for episodic exemplar models of phonology, and the role of acoustic memory and word frequency encoding in diachronic sound change </p>
