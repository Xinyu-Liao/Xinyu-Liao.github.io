I'm a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in studying the mental representation and inherent variability of phonetics-phonology and morphology in human language faculty and mental lexicon through experiments, psycholinguistic methods, computational modeling, and variationist sociolinguistics. 

Here is a list of the topics that I'm currently working on:
1. Perceptual Adaptation and Sound Change: supervised by Dr.[Yoonjung Kang](https://www.yoonjungkang.com/), I'm exploring the phonetic recaliberation/adaptation in speech perception with implications for usage-based models of phonology and mechanisms of diachronic sound change
2. Loanword Phonology: I'm interested in the adaptation of non-native sound structures in native (morpho)phonology by using dictionary data and on-line adaptation experiments.  
3. Sociophonetic Cognition: Drs. [Derek Dennis](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/people/derek-denis), [Jessamyn Schertz](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jschertz/index.shtml) and I are currently working on social perception of prosodic variation in multicultural Toronto English
4. Language Variation and Documentation: My MPhil thesis focused on documenting ongoing sound changes in Tsat, an endangered Austronesian language in Hainan, China. I am also committed to documenting variation at all structural levels, including morphosyntactic and discourse-pragmatic variables
5. Bilingualism & Language/Dialect Contact: bilingual and bi-dialectal speaker's speech production & perception, acquisition of second dialect morphology and phonology

I've graduated with an MPhil (Distinction) in Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), where I worked with Drs. [Miriam Meyerhoff](https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/professor-miriam-meyerhoff),  [Jose Elias-Ulloa](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/jose-elias-ulloa), and [Matt Hunt Gardner](https://www.matthuntgardner.com). 

I'll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out :)
