I'm a first-year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in studying phonetics and phonology through experiments, perception/psycholinguistics, computational modeling, and sociolinguistic methods. 

Here is a list of the topics that I'm currently working on:
1. Perceptual adaptation: supervised by Dr.[Yoonjung Kang](https://www.yoonjungkang.com/), I'm exploring the phonetic recaliberation/adaptation in speech perception with implications for usage-based models of phonology and mechanisms of diachronic sound change
2. Phonology and Phonetics of language/dialect contact & bi-/multilingualism: loanword phonology, second dialect phonology, bilingual and bi-dialectal speaker's speech production & perception
3. Sociophonetic Cognition: Drs. [Derek Dennis](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/people/derek-denis), [Jessamyn Schertz](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jschertz/index.shtml) and I are currently working on social perception of prosodic variation in multicultural Toronto English
4. Sociolinguistic variation and documentation of under-studied languages in Asia-Pacific

I've graduated with an MPhil (Distinction) in Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), where I worked with Drs. [Miriam Meyerhoff](https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/professor-miriam-meyerhoff),  [Jose Elias-Ulloa](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/people/jose-elias-ulloa), and [Matt Hunt Gardner](https://www.matthuntgardner.com). 

I'll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out :)
